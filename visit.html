<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/see1.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.skyline.co.nz/')"><h2>Skyline Gondola</h2><p>Hop aboard for fantastic views. At the top there's the inevitable cafe, restaurant, souvenir shop and observation deck, as well as the Queenstown Bike Park, Skyline Luge, Ledge Bungy, Ledge Swing and Ziptrek Ecotours.</p></div>

<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/see2.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://kiwibird.co.nz/kiwi/')"><h2>Kiwi Birdlife Park</h2><p>These five acres are home to 10,000 native plants, tuatara and scores of birds, including kiwi, kea, moreporks, parakeets and extremely rare black stilts. Stroll around the aviaries, watch the conservation show, and tiptoe quietly into the darkened kiwi houses.</p></div>

<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/see3.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.newzealand.com/int/feature/lake-wakatipu/')"><h2>Lake Wakatipu</h2><p>Shaped like a perfect cartoon thunderbolt, this gorgeous lake has a 212km shoreline and reaches a depth of 379m (the average depth is over 320m). Five rivers flow into it but only one (the Kawarau) flows out, making it prone to sometimes quite dramatic floods.</p></div>

<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/see4.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.gibbstonvalleynz.com/')"><h2>Gibbston Valley</h2><p>The area's oldest commercial winery (established in the early 1980s), Gibbston Valley makes excellent pinot noir and has a large visitor complex incorporating a restaurant and a 'cheesery'. Tours of the winery and the impressive wine cave leave on the hour from 10am to 4pm. In summer, large concerts (mainly starring past-their-prime old rockers) are held on the grounds.</p></div>

<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/see5.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.qldc.govt.nz/leisure-and-culture/parks-and-walkways/queenstown-lakes-district-parks-and-reserves/queenstown-gardens/')"><h2>Queenstown Gardens</h2><p>Set on its own little tongue of land framing Queenstown Bay, this pretty park was laid out in 1876 by those garden-loving Victorians as a place to promenade. The clothes may have changed (they've certainly shrunk), but people still flock to this leafy peninsula to stroll, picnic and laze about. Less genteel types head straight for the frisbee golf course.</p></div>

<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/see6.png); " onclick="window.open('http://www.peregrinewines.co.nz/')"><h2>Peregrine</h2><p>Peregrine is one of Gibbston's top wineries, producing excellent sauvignon blanc, pinot gris, riesling and, of course, pinot noir. Also impressive is the winery's architecture â€“ a bunker-like building with a roof reminiscent of a falcon's wing in flight. They host occasional outdoor concerts during summer, sometimes featuring international names.</p></div>

<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/see7.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.stpeters.co.nz/')"><h2>St Peter's Anglican Church</h2><p>This pretty wood-beamed stone building (1932) has colourful stained glass and an impressive gilded and painted organ. Take a look at the eagle-shaped cedar lectern, carved and donated in 1874 by Ah Tong, a Chinese immigrant.</p></div>
