<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/eat1.png); " onclick="window.open('http://www.fergburger.com/fullscreen.html')"><h2>Fergbaker</h2><p>Fergburger's sweeter sister bakes all manner of tempting treats – and although most things look tasty with 3am beer goggles on, it withstands the daylight test admirably. Goodies include meat pies, filled rolls, danish pastries and banoffee tarts. If you're after gelato, call into Mrs Ferg next door.</p></div>

<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/eat2.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.ratadining.co.nz/')"><h2>Rata</h2><p>After gaining Michelin stars for restaurants in London, New York and LA, chef-owner Josh Emett has brought his exceptional but surprisingly unflashy cooking back home in the form of this upmarket but informal back-lane eatery. Native bush, edging the windows and in a large-scale photographic mural, sets the scene for a short menu showcasing the best seasonal NZ produce.</p></div>

<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/eat3.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.bluekanu.co.nz/')"><h2>Blue Kanu</h2><p>Disproving the rule that all tiki houses are inherently tacky, Blue Kanu somehow manages to be not just tasteful but stylish. The menu meshes robust Māori, Pasifika and Asian flavours with local ingredients to come up with an exotic blend of delicious dishes, designed to be shared. The service is excellent, too.</p></div>

<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/eat4.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.vudu.co.nz/')"><h2>Vudu Cafe</h2><p>This local favourite has been sorting out caffeine fixes for nearly 20 years. Food-wise they box above their weight, particularly with their beautifully presented and non-run-of-the-mill breakfasts. The decor enthusiastically embraces Kiwiana, with tourist landscapes framed in kitschy etched-glass mirrors, souvenir teaspoons and lots of crazy sheep-themed art.</p></div>

<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/eat5.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.publickitchen.co.nz/')"><h2>Public Kitchen & Bar</h2><p>The trend towards informal, shared dining has come to Queenstown in the form of this excellent waterfront eatery. Grab a posse and order a selection of plates of varying sizes from the menu; the meaty dishes, in particular, are excellent.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/eat6.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://www.madamwoo.co.nz/queenstown')"><h2>Madam Woo</h2><p>Wooing customers with a playful take on Chinese and Malay hawker food, the Madame serves up lots of tasty snacks for sharing (wontons, steamed dumplings, greasy filled-roti rolls), alongside larger dishes (beef rendang, duck salad, sambal prawns). Kids and distracted adults alike can have fun colouring in the menu.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="visit">
<div class="see" style="background-image:url(gallery/eat7.jpg); " onclick="window.open('http://tacomedic.co.nz/')"><h2>Taco Medic</h2><p>Operating out of a food truck by the bike-hire place on Brecon St, these convivial lads dispense tacos of tasty fish, beef, pork belly and black bean to a devoted group of fans. One's a snack and two's a meal. During the ski season they move to an empty lot on the corner of Gorge Rd and Bowen St.</p></div>

As the name implies, there's always a decent selection of steak on the menu, but much more besides, including locally sourced fish and lamb.</p></div>
